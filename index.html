                    <strong>Psiakowo</strong> was founded in 1932, in central Warsaw. Since then, it was passed down through the family, each member making their own adjustments and improvements, until eventually we became the Psiakowo that we all know and love. We strive to not only expand our bussiness, but to build the foundations for a new world, full of animal friendly dineries. With twenty five properties in our name, we are well on our way to become local leaders, setting high standards, evoking high expectations, and most importantly, contributing to a more pawsome future!
